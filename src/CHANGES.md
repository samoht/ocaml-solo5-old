## 0.6.4 (2019-11-14)

This release updates the Genode and Muen bindings, and fixes the following
notable issues:

* Disk images produced by solo5-virtio-mkimage were not bootable due to changes
  in recent SYSLINUX versions (thanks to Ricardo Koller, @ricarkol for finding
  the fix).
* Build failure on FreeBSD 12.1+ (clang 8.0.1) due to issues with TLS in the
  toolchain.

New features:

* "configure.sh" has a new "--only-tools" option, which builds no tenders or
  bindings. In conjunction with "make install-tools", this can be used to
  install "solo5-elftool" only. This is intended for downstream systems which
  need to make use of "solo5-elftool" to query manifest information.
* A "scripts/opam-release.sh" tool has been added to generate OPAM repository
  metadata as part of the Solo5 release process.

Apart from that, this release contains documentation updates and the "hvt"
tender on the aarch64 architecture is now considered production-quality.

## 0.6.3 (2019-10-08)

This release fixes a build problem with Linux distributions such as OpenSUSE
which install libseccomp headers into subdirectories of /usr/include. Note that
this introduces pkg-config as a dependency for building Solo5 on Linux.

No functional changes.

## 0.6.2 (2019-09-23)

This release fixes further OPAM/MirageOS installation problems found by CI, and
the following build problems:

* spt: Support ppc64le on RedHat (thanks to Stefan Berger, @stefanberger).
* Fix check/warning for libseccomp >= 2.3.3 (thanks to Mechiel Lukkien, @mjl-).

No functional changes.

## 0.6.1 (2019-09-19)

This release fixes OPAM/MirageOS installation problems found by CI. No
functional changes.

Additionally, the following entry was missed from the changes for 0.6.0:

* Solo5 tenders, tools and bindings now have an embedded version number, using
  the well-known convention "v0.6.0-4-gc9786d87". Bindings will log the version
  number during start-up. As a consequence of this, Solo5 now needs to be built
  from either a Git tree or a tarball produced by "make distrib". Suitable
  tarballs are uploaded to Github during the release process.

## 0.6.0 (2019-09-19)

This is a major feature release which introduces the concept of an "application
manifest", which enables support for multiple network and block devices.

This release removes the compile-time specialization of the "hvt" tender. While
this was a nice experiment, it is not practical for real-world deployment
scenarios where it is expected that the party supplying the tender (i.e. the
operator / user) will be different to the party supplying the unikernel (i.e.
the developer).

Due to these and other changes, both the public Solo5 APIs (as defined and
documented in solo5.h) and internal tenders/bindings ABI have changed.
Likewise, the build process for Solo5-based unikernels has changed, and
downstream projects will need to be updated.

Please refer to the following list of changes and the Solo5 documentation in
docs/ for details.

New features:

* Application manifest and support for multiple devices. New APIs have been
  added and existing APIs changed. See solo5.h for details. A new tool,
  "solo5-elftool" has been added to generate the binary application manifest
  from JSON source.
* New "spt" (sandboxed process tender) target, allows running Solo5-based
  unikernels as user processes on Linux, using a minimal, strict seccomp-BPF
  sandbox for isolation. Runs on the x86\_64, aarch64 and ppc64le processor
  architectures.
* Compile-time specialization of the "hvt" (hardware virtualized tender) target
  has been removed. Two variants of the "hvt" tender are built, "solo5-hvt" and
  "solo5-hvt-debug" with support for GDB and guest coredumps where available.
* Both the "hvt" and "spt" tenders and bindings now have an internal ABI
  version, and this ABI version is embedded into the unikernel binary. Tenders
  will not run a binary whose ABI version or target does not match.
* Downsteam libOS projects using custom linker scripts for Solo5 will need to
  be updated to handle the ELF NOTEs used to embed the ABI version and
  application manifest in a Solo5 binary.

Security improvements:

* Stack smashing protection is now supported and all bindings, tenders and
  other host tools are built with -fstack-protector-strong. This setting is
  also passed down to MirageOS unikernels via OPAM/pkg-config.
* On Linux, tenders are built with -z noexecstack to enforce a non-executable
  stack.
* Low memory, including the zero page, is now unmapped on "hvt", "spt" and
  "virtio" targets. Tender-internal structures in this memory range are mapped
  read-only.
* Tests for W^X / guest-side page protections have been added and are enforced
  on those targets where this is supported.
* The ELF loader used by tenders has undergone extensive review and
  re-factoring, and fixes for a number of potential security issues have been
  put in place.

Other changes:

* The "hvt" tender now uses epoll(7) on Linux and kqueue(2) on the BSDs for
  network I/O.
* The "hvt" tender "--dumpcore" option now requires a directory, which must
  exist at run time.
* The printf() implementation used by bindings has been replaced with a much
  better implementation from https://github.com/mpaland/printf.
* The `solo5_set_tls_base()` API has been added to give language runtimes that
  wish to manipulate the architecture-specific TLS base register an interface
  for it.
* Many bug fixes, improvements and a lot of code review throughout.
* A C11 compiler is now required, to allow for the use of `_Static_assert()`.

Known issues:

* Full W^X support is currently only possible on the "spt" target. Partial
  support is possible for the "hvt" target running on Linux/KVM hosts. (#303)
* On OpenBSD, "hvt" operation with multiple network devices results in packet
  loss. This appears to be a bug in kqueue(2) but we have no confirmation from
  upstream. (#374)

## 0.5.0 (N/A)

* Skipped for version numbering consistency with downstream MirageOS/Solo5
  components.

## 0.4.1 (2018-11-08)

This release introduces experimental support for the Genode Operating System
Framework as a target for Solo5-based unikernels, and basic support for
dropping "root" privileges in the "hvt" tender on FreeBSD and OpenBSD.

Other changes:

* Migrate OPAM integration to OPAM 2.

## 0.4.0 (2018-09-14)

This release is a major restructuring and renaming of Solo5 components,
primarily to reflect that the "ukvm monitor" is no longer specific to the KVM
hypervisor and to allow for future development of further targets and tenders
enabling different sandboxing technologies.

Major changes:

* `kernel/X`: Moved to `bindings/X`, now referred to as the "Solo5 _bindings_
  for X".  Build products are now named `bindings/X/solo5_X.o`.
  * `kernel/solo5.h`: Moved to `include/solo5/solo5.h`.
* _ukvm_: Target has been renamed to _hvt_. Monitor code is now referred to as
  the hvt _tender_ and has been moved to `tenders/hvt/`.
  * `ukvm-configure`: Now named `solo5-hvt-configure`.
  * `ukvm-bin`: Now named `solo5-hvt`.
  * `ukvm/ukvm_guest.h`: Renamed to `include/solo5/hvt_abi.h`.
* Generated VM names used on FreeBSD and OpenBSD have been changed from
  `ukvm%d` to `solo5-%d`, with `%d` being the PID of the `solo5-hvt` tender.
* Core file names produced by the _hvt_ dumpcore module have been changed from
  `core.ukvm.%d` to `core.solo5-hvt.%d`.
* `solo5-run-virtio` and `solo5-mkimage`: Renamed to `solo5-virtio-run` and
  `solo5-virtio-mkimage` respectively.
* OPAM packages used by MirageOS have been renamed from `solo5-kernel-X` to
  `solo5-bindings-X`, accounting for the change from `ukvm` to `hvt`. Full
  details of the impact of this change on existing Mirage/Solo5 installations
  will be provided separately as part of a MirageOS release.

For further details please refer to the discussion and commits merged as part
of #274.

Other changes:

* Update OpenBSD requirements to 6.4 and minor OpenBSD build fixes (#270, #273).

## 0.3.1 (2018-08-10)

Minor point release with build fixes:

* Fix array-bounds compilation error with newer compilers (#266, #267).
* Synchronise with OpenBSD vmmvar.h changes (#268).

## 0.3.0 (2018-06-15)

a.k.a. the "longest-overdue release in the history of the project", hopefully
to stay that way.

The biggest user-visible changes by far are the porting of ukvm to run on
FreeBSD and OpenBSD vmm, and the addition of support for the Muen Separation
Kernel as a host system. Oh, and support for ARM64 as a host architecture.

Major changes:

* Internal re-design and refactoring to enable support for multi-{arch,
  host system} (#171, #192).
* ukvm: FreeBSD vmm support (#171).
* ukvm: OpenBSD vmm support (#226).
* Support for Muen Separation Kernel as a host system (#190).
* aarch64 support (#209).
* Much improved support for GDB server in ukvm (#198).
* ukvm: Support for post-mortem debugging (guest core dumps) (#258).
* ukvm: Support for setting guest memory size with --mem (#211).
* Public (unikernel-facing) API refresh, documentation and cleanups (#244,
  #245).
* Self-tests reworked using "bats" framework (#246).
